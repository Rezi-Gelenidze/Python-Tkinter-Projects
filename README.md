# Calculator & Image Viewer - Python Tkinter GUI Projects (2020)

This repository contains simple GUI projects developed using Python's Tkinter library during my learning phase in 2020. The projects showcase basic functionalities such as a calculator and an image viewer.

## Projects

### Calculator (`calculator.py`)

A basic calculator application built using Tkinter. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations and displays the results on the screen.

#### Key Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Clear and delete functionality
- Input validation for legal characters (numbers, operators, parentheses)

### Image Viewer (`image_viewer.py`)

An image viewer application for browsing through images stored in the current directory. It includes functionalities for resizing and navigating between images.

#### Key Features:
- Scans and displays images from the current directory
- Resizes images to fit the application window
- Navigation buttons to move between images

## Usage

To run these applications, clone the repository and execute the Python scripts. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (Tkinter, PIL) installed.

```
python calculator.py
python image_viewer.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes with Python)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
